For marine debris detection and removal, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are a potential solution. In this letter, we focus on the efficiency of AUV vision for real-time marine debris detection. First, we improved the efficiency of a class of state-of-the-art object detectors, namely EfficientDets [1], by 1.5% AP on D0, 2.6% AP on D1, 1.2% AP on D2 and 1.3% AP on D3 without increasing the GPU latency (see Fig. 1). Subsequently, we created and made publicly available a dataset for the detection of in-water plastic bags and bottles and trained our improved EfficientDets on this and on two public datasets for marine debris detection. Finally, we began the testing of real-time detection performance on a simulator of marine environments."
PA_WF,Real-Time Instance Segmentation for Detection of Underwater Litter as a Plastic Source,Brendan Chongzhi Corrigan; Z. Y. Tay; D.

While floating and beach litter are often in the spotlight, about 70% of marine litter eventually sinks to the seafloor, making underwater litter the largest accumulation of marine litter that often goes undetected. Plastic debris makes up the majority of ocean litter and is a known source of microplastics in the ocean. This paper focuses on the detection of ocean plastic using neural network models. Two neural network models will be trained, i.e., YOLACT and the Mask R-CNN, for the instance segmentation of underwater litter in images. The models are trained on the TrashCAN dataset, using pre-trained model weights trained using COCO. The trained neural network could achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.377 and 0.365 for the Mask R-CNN and YOLACT, respectively. The lightweight nature of YOLACT allows it to detect images at up to six times the speed of the Mask R-CNN, while only making a comparatively smaller trade-off in terms of performance. This allows for two separate applications: YOLACT for the collection of litter using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and the Mask R-CNN for surveying litter distribution."
MA_WF,An Ultracompact Underwater Pulsed Digital Holographic Camera With Rapid Particle Image Extraction Suite,T. Thevar; N. Burns; Michael Ockwell; J.

With a footprint of 9 cm diameter × 60 cm long and weighing just 3.5 kg, to our knowledge, this is the lightest and most compact system of its kind in the world. It can be easily adapted for mounting on remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). weeHoloCam can record 12 cm3 of the water column per hologram at 20 Hz and has a capacity to continuously record up to 200 000 holograms, each 5 MB in size. Along with the holographic camera, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-accelerated hologram analysis suite has been developed. The 838 megapixel/s reconstruction speed demonstrated is the highest reported speed for a single FPGA implementation to date. This is an extremely important development as rapid processing of recorded holograms is vital for the viability of subsea holographic cameras. weeHoloCam was successfully trialed in the North Sea, recording close to a hundred thousand holograms and extracting particle images within those holograms at a rate of 190 per min. weeHoloCam has the potential to play an important role in several oceanic studies: spatial and temporal monitoring of plankton species; study of plankton dynamics; study of vertical transport of floc; and monitoring microplastic pollution in the ocean, to name but a few."

However, the marine environment is getting increasingly severe, and the garbage in the ocean and fishnets cast by fishermen have a great negative influence on the work of AUV. To solve the problems of low precision and slow speed in the state-of-the-art network detection of weak and small targets in underwater sonar images, Yolo5 was improved by building the multi-branch shuttle neural network The dataset is collected by multi-beam forward-looking sonar Gemini720i, and includes “fishnet” and two representative types of knitted and plastic garbage, i.e., “cloth” and “plasticbag”. The original dataset is enhanced and balanced, and the effect of dataset distribution on the model performance is studied. Utilizing pre-training, the effects of Yolo5 family, i.e., Yolo5s, Yolo5m, Yolo5l and Yolo5x are compared using the balanced dataset, to explore the impacts on detecting weak and small targets of the deeper and wider networks of this family. In addition, the combinations of Yolo5s with lightweight networks, i.e., MobileNet3 and ShuffleNet2 are experimented, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed network, and can satisfy the high accuracy and real-time requirements of AUV."
PA_WF,A Novel Multi-Robot Task Allocation Model in Marine Plastics Cleaning Based on Replicator Dynamics,Le Hong; Weicheng Cui; Hao Chen,"['robot', 'marine', 'underwater', 'autonomous', 'optimization']",10.0,Journal of Marine Science and Engineering,2021.0,10.3390/jmse9080879,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/313de1e5f988c40d3fce31f381575d4d3b3d8fd7,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/9/8/879/pdf?version=1628947523,"As marine plastic pollution threatens the marine ecosystem seriously, the government needs to find an effective way to clean marine plastics. Due to the advantages of easy operation and high efficiency, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been applied to clean marine plastics. As for the large-scale marine environment, the marine plastic cleaning task needs to be accomplished through the collaborative work of multiple AUVs. Assigning the cleaning task to each AUV reasonably and effectively has an essential impact on improving cleaning efficiency. The coordination of AUVs is subjected to harsh communication conditions. Therefore, to release the dependence on the underwater communications among AUVs, proposing a reliable multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) model is necessary. Inspired by the evolutionary game theory, this paper proposes a novel multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) model based on replicator dynamics for marine plastic cleaning. This novel model not only satisfies the minimization of the cost function, but also reaches a relatively stable state of the task allocation. A novel optimization algorithm, equilibrium optimizer (EO), is adopted as the optimizer. The simulation results validate the correctness of the results achieved by EO and the applicability of the proposed model. At last, several valuable conclusions are obtained from the simulations on the three different assumed AUVs."

The accumulation of litter and plastic debris at the seafloor and the bottom of rivers are extremely harmful for the aquatic life. We propose a solution for monitoring this problem using a team of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to exchange the recorded video in order to reconstruct the map of regions of interest. However, underwater video transmission is a challenge in the harsh environment in which radio-frequency waves are absorbed for distances above a few tens of meters, optical waves require narrow laser beams and suffer from scattering and ocean wave motion, and acoustic waves-while long range-provide a very low bandwidth and unreliable channel for communication. In our solution, the scalable coded video of each vehicle is shared in-network with a selected group of receiving vehicles through the underwater acoustic channel. Presented evaluations, including both simulations and experiments, confirm the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed solution using acoustic software-defined modems."

Surveys have shown that <5 mm plastic particles, known as microplastics, are significantly more abundant in surface seawater and on shorelines than larger plastic particles are. Nevertheless, quantification of microplastics in the environment is hampered by a lack of adequate high-throughput methods for distinguishing and quantifying smaller size fractions (<1 mm), and this has probably resulted in an underestimation of actual microplastic concentrations. Here we present a protocol that allows high-throughput detection and automated quantification of small microplastic particles (20-1000 μm) using the dye Nile red, fluorescence microscopy, and image analysis software. This protocol has proven to be highly effective in the quantification of small polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and nylon-6 particles, which frequently occur in the water column. Our preliminary results from sea surface tows show a power-law increase in small microplastics (i.e., <1 mm) with a decreasing particle size. Hence, our data help to resolve speculation about the ""apparent"" loss of this fraction from surface waters. We consider that this method presents a step change in the ability to detect small microplastics by substituting the subjectivity of human visual sorting with a sensitive and semiautomated procedure."

The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms. Because of these consequences, microplastics have become an increasing concern as a newly emerging potential threat, and therefore, the control of microplastics in aquatic media is required. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing and newly developed methods for detecting and separating microplastics from discharged wastewater, which are the ultimate challenges in the microplastic treatment systems. A critical study on the effect of microplastics on aquatic organisms and human health is also discussed. Thus, this analysis provides a complete understanding of entire strategies for detecting and removing microplastics and their associated issues to ensure a waste discharge standard to minimize the ultimate potential impact in aquatic environments."

Studies from stream ecology and waste-water treatment have shown that biofilm functionality depends to a great extent on community structure. Here we present a fast and easy-to-use method for individual cell-based analysis of stream biofilms, based on stain-free flow cytometry and visualization of the high-dimensional data by viSNE. The method allows the combined assessment of community structure, decay of phototrophic organisms and presence of abiotic particles. In laboratory experiments, it allows quantification of cellular decay and detection of survival of larger cells after temperature stress, while in the field it enables detection of community structure changes that correlate with known environmental drivers (flow conditions, dissolved organic carbon, calcium) and detection of microplastic contamination. The method can potentially be applied to other biofilm types, for example, for inferring community structure for environmental and industrial research and monitoring. The interpretation of high-dimensional flow cytometry data is difficult and time consuming. Here, Sgier et al.present an improved method that combines stain-free flow cytometry with viSNE data visualization for the analysis of microbial biofilms."

Complementary methods for the robust detection of tissue MNPs, including pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, confirm the presence of MNPs in human kidney, liver and brain. MNPs in these organs primarily consist of polyethylene, with lesser but significant concentrations of other polymers. Brain tissues harbor higher proportions of polyethylene compared to the composition of the plastics in liver or kidney, and electron microscopy verified the nature of the isolated brain MNPs, which present largely as nanoscale shard-like fragments. Plastic concentrations in these decedent tissues were not influenced by age, sex, race/ethnicity or cause of death; the time of death (2016 versus 2024) was a significant factor, with increasing MNP concentrations over time in both liver and brain samples (P = 0.01). Finally, even greater accumulation of MNPs was observed in a cohort of decedent brains with documented dementia diagnosis, with notable deposition in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells. These results highlight a critical need to better understand the routes of exposure, uptake and clearance pathways and potential health consequences of plastics in human tissues, particularly in the brain."

To date there is no universally accepted protocol for isolation and quantification of microplastics from aqueous media. Various methodologies exist, many of which are time consuming and have the potential to introduce contaminants into samples, thereby obscuring characterization of the environmental microplastic load. Here, we present first steps in the detection of microplastics in liquid samples, based on their fluorescent staining followed by high throughput analysis and quantification using Flow Cytometry. Using controlled laboratory settings nine polymer types [polystyrene (PS); polyethylene (PE); polyethylene terephthalate (PET/PETE); high density polyethylene (HDPE); low density polyethylene (LDPE); polyvinyl chloride (PVC); polypropylene (PP); nylon (PA); polycarbonate (PC)] were tested for identification and quantification in freshwater. All nine plastic types were stained with 10 μg/mL Nile Red in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide with a 10 min incubation time. The lowest spatial detectable limit for plastic particles was 200 nm. Out of the nine polymer types chosen for the study PS, PE, PET, and PC were well-identified; however, results for other plastic types (PVC, PP, PA, LDPE, and HDPE) were masked to certain extent by Nile Red aggregation and precipitation. The methodology presented here permits identification of a range of particle sizes and types. It represents a significant step in the quantification of microplastics by replacing visual data interpretation with a sensitive and automated method."

However, the management of plastic wastes, particularly in African countries, is inadequate and most of the plastic debris is gatewayed into the water bodies. Nowadays, environmentalists, organizations, and governments are aware of microplastic pollution in the marine and terrestrial environment. Thus, addressing a compressive literature review in one referenced paper, as they draw up the articles, is essential to propose new research directions, to synthesize the existing theories among the existing studies. The abundance of microplastics is variable depending on the sampling and identification techniques. In this review, the available publications on microplastic pollution in African countries’ water systems were retrieved. Investigations found that microplastic pollution levels in the studied water bodies were reported in high concentrations. It was observed that different sampling and analytical methods were applied for the detection of microplastics, and suggestions were raised at it may affect the reliability of the results. Most of the detected and quantified microplastics were confirmed as they are from secondary sources. Most of the microplastic pollution research was conducted dominantly in South Africa, and secondly Nigeria, although other countries should also start conducting in their water systems. Surface water and sediment samples were dominantly carried out, but are limited with biota samples; hence, the risk assessment of microplastics is not yet determined. Some of the African countries have regulations on the prevention of macroplastic wastes, but the implementations are unsuccessful and most have not yet been established resulting in a threat of microplastics pollution. Thus, the research priorities on microplastic detection should be identified, and the African countries’ governments should be more proactive in eradicating macroplastic, which ends up as microplastics, pollutions in the water environments. Researches on microplastic pollution in African countries water system is limited . A high microplastics abundance is found in African countries water system. Sampling methods and used analytical techniques for microplastic detection were included. Harmonized standard methods for microplastic pollution research should be established. Combined analytical tools at once should be adopted to detect reliable microplastics. Researches on microplastic pollution in African countries water system is limited .

However, we know less about the presence, fate, and input paths of microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems. A possible entry path for microplastic into terrestrial ecosystems is the agricultural application of sewage sludge and solid bio-waste as fertilizers. Microplastic contained in sewage sludge also includes polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which could originate as fiber from textile products or as a fragment from packaging products (foils, bottles, etc.). Information about microplastic content in such environmental samples is limited yet, as most of the used analytical methods are very time-consuming, regarding sample preparation and detection, require sophisticated analytical tools and eventually need high user knowledge. Results Here, we present a simple, specific tool for the analysis of PET microplastic particles based on alkaline extraction of PET from the environmental matrix and subsequent determination of the monomers, terephthalic acid, using liquid chromatography with UV detection (LC-UV). The applicability of the method is shown for different types of PET in several soil-related, terrestrial environmental samples, e.g., soil, sediment, compost, fermentation residues, but also sewage sludge, suspended particles from urban water management systems, and indoor dust. Recoveries for model samples are between 94.5 and 107.1%. Limit of determination and limit of quantification are absolute masses of 0.031 and 0.121 mg PET, respectively. In order to verify the measured mass contents of the environmental samples, a method comparison with thermal extraction-desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TED-GC/MS) was conducted. Both methods deliver similar results and corroborated each other. PET mass contents in environmental samples range from values below LOQ in agriculture soil up to 57,000 mg kg −1 in dust samples. Conclusions We demonstrate the potential of an integral method based on chemical extraction for the determination of PET mass contents in solid environmental samples. The method was successfully applied to various matrices and may serve as an analytical tool for further investigations of PET-based microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems."

The increasing daily use and release of plastics into the environment have led to the accumulation of fragmented microplastics, with potentially awful consequences for the environment, and animal and human health. The detection and identification of microplastics are of utmost importance, but available methods are still limited. In this work, a new approach is presented for the analysis of microplastics based on hydrophobic fluorescence staining with Nile Red, using spectrally resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Significant differences were observed in the emission spectra and fluorescence lifetimes of the analyzed microplastics. Nile Red fluorescence shows determinable behavior based on the polymer matrix and provides a fingerprint for the identification of fragments from different types of plastics. Lifetime imaging coupled with phasor analysis constitutes a fast, robust, and straightforward method for mapping and identifying different microplastics within the same sample in an aquatic environment."

However, their rapid identification is hindered by the need for complex isolation and pre-treatment methods. This study describes a comprehensive sensing platform to identify MPs in environmental samples without requiring independent separation or pre-treatment protocols. It leverages the physicochemical properties of macroporous-mesoporous silver (Ag) substrates templated with self-assembled polymeric micelles to concurrently separate and analyze multiple MP targets using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The hydrophobic layer on Ag aids in stabilizing the nanostructures in the environment and mitigates biofouling. To monitor complex samples with multiple MPs and to demultiplex numerous overlapping patterns, we develop a neural network (NN) algorithm called SpecATNet that employs a self-attention mechanism to resolve the complex dependencies and patterns in SERS data to identify six common types of MPs: polystyrene, polyethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate. SpecATNet uses multi-label classification to analyze multi-component mixtures even in the presence of various interference agents. The combination of macroporous-mesoporous Ag substrates and self-attention-based NN technology holds potential to enable field monitoring of MPs by generating rich datasets that machines can interpret and analyze."

With the microbiota colonization of MPs being firmly established, MPs became an important carrier for contaminants to step inside the food web all the way up to humans. Thus, the continuous feed of MPs into the ecosystem has sparked a multitude of scientific concerns about their toxicity, characterization, and interactions with microorganisms and other contaminants. The reports of common subthemes have agreed about many findings and research gaps but also showed contradictions about others. To unravel these equivocal conflicts, we herein compile all the major findings and analyze the paramount discrepancies among these review papers. Furthermore, we systematically reviewed all the highlights, research gaps, concerns, and future needs. The covered focus areas of MPs' literature include the sources, occurrence, fate, existence, and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), toxicity, interaction with microbiota, sampling, characterization, data quality, and interaction with other co-contaminants. This study reveals that many mechanisms of MPs' behavior in aquatic environments like degradation and interaction with microbiota are yet to be comprehended. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical need to standardize methods and parameters for MP characterization to improve the comparability and reproducibility of the incoming research."

In-situ detection of MP in water bodies is essential for clear assessment of the ecological risks of MPs. The present study proposes a method based on polarized light scattering which measures the polarization parameters of the scattered light at 120° to detect MP in water. This method takes the advantage of in-situ measurement of the individual particles and the experimental setup in principle is used. By use of the measured polarization parameters equipped by machine learning, the standard polystyrene (PS) spheres, natural water sample, and lab-cultured microalgae are explicitly discriminated, and MP with different physical and chemical properties can be differentiated. It can also characterize the weathering of different MP and identify the specific type from multiple types of MP. This study explores the capability of the proposed method to detect the physical and chemical properties, weathering state and concentration of MP in water which promises the future application in water quality sensing and monitoring."

To meet this requirement, an underwater microscope with an electrically controlled variable lens was designed and tested. The captured microscopic images of corals, sediments, planktons, and microplastic revealed their physical, biological, and morphological characteristics. Further studies of the images also revealed the growth, degradation, and bleaching patterns of corals; the presence of plankton communities; and the types of microplastics. The imaging performance is majorly influenced by the choice of lenses, camera selection, and lighting method. Image dehazing, global saturation masks, and image histograms were used to extract the image features. Fundamental experimental proof was obtained with micro-scale images of corals, sediments, planktons, and microplastic at different magnifications. The designed underwater microscope can provide relevant new insights into the observation and detection of the future conditions of aquatic ecosystems."

However, as wastewater is collected from households, industries, and hospitals, the resulting sludge could contaminate land with creeping levels of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and microplastics, among others. Thus, the sustainable management of SS requires the development of selective methods for the identification and quantification of pollutants, preventing ecological and/or health risks. This study presents a thorough evaluation of emerging and priority micropollutants in SS, through the lens of environmental insights, by developing and implementing an integrated analytical approach. A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction method, coupled with gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, was optimized for the determination of 42 organic compounds. These include organophosphorus pesticides, organochlorine pesticides, pyrethroid pesticides, organophosphate ester flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The optimization of the dispersive-solid phase for clean-up, combined with the optimization of chromatographic parameters, ensured improved sensitivity. Method validation included assessments for recovery, reproducibility, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). Recoveries ranged from 59.5 to 117%, while LODs ranged from 0.00700 to 0.271 µg g^-1. Application of the method to seven SS samples from Portuguese wastewater treatment plants revealed the presence of sixteen compounds, including persistent organic pollutants. The quantification of α-endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide, was consistently observed in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.110 to 0.571 µg g^-1. Furthermore, the study encompasses the analysis of agronomic parameters, as well as the mineral and metal content in SS samples. The study demonstrates that the levels of heavy metals comply with legal limits. By conducting a comprehensive investigation into the presence of micropollutants in SS, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the environmental and sustainable implications associated with SS management.
